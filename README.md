Project 0: Racing Game

This project was completed over the course of two days. The goal was to complete a functional game that two users could use a single keyboard to play. My decision was to go with keyboard click to resemble a "button mashing game". The mainpoint of the game is to get across the board quicker than your opponent via repeated key board clicks/taps.

##Technologies Used
*javascript
*jquery

##Existing Features
*Functional keyboard clicks using "1" and "0" to move forwards
*Text to alert the player that they won
*Ability to reset the game board

##Planned Features
*Make use of object oriented programming
*Develop a win counter

*Track winning times and best times
*Integrate Spotify API
